# Anisha
The *Anisha* is to build two XML-based DSLs for animating basic shapes using [PsiXML Interpreter and PsiEngine](http://hilas.ii.uam.es/api). 
The case of study will be used as an illustrative example, which details the interpretation and execution 
processes of multiple programs as well as the information binding in [PsiEngine](http://hilas.ii.uam.es).
